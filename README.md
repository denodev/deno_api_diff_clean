# Deno Api Diff Clean

> Easier Deno upgrades by clearly expose changes from a version to another. ðŸš€

This is a **clear** version of [deno_api_diff](https://github.com/denodev/deno_api_diff), without comments and some irrelevant information.

A dedicated branch per version makes changes very easy to watch.
For example:

* https://github.com/denodev/deno_api_diff_clean/compare/0.39.0...0.40.0
(change in `lib.deno.shared_globals.d.ts`)
* https://github.com/denodev/deno_api_diff_clean/compare/0.38.0...0.39.0
(change in `lib.deno.ns.d.ts` )
* https://github.com/denodev/deno_api_diff_clean/compare/0.37.0...0.37.1
(no change)

See table below for the complete list.
